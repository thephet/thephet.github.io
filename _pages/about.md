## About this website

This website was done using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and it is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>. In particular, I used the theme [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes). If you like how my website looks, you can check on my Github repository, but I highly recommend that you check the one from Minimal Mistakes directly.

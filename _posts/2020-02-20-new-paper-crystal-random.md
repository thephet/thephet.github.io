After a long drought I have finally published a paper! And it has been mostly thanks to Dr Eddy Lee, who is the first author of the paper and conducted most of the work.
The name of the paper is ["A Crystallization Robot for Generating True Random Numbers Based on Stochastic Chemical Processes"](https://www.cell.com/matter/fulltext/S2590-2385(20)30024-2), and it was published on the journal [Matter](https://www.cell.com/matter/home), which is a new'ish journal from the Cell group. And the best thing is that the article is Open Access, so if you click on that link, you can read it for free.

The paper is about using crystals to generate random numbers. My work consisted mostly on using Computer Vision to find crystals on vials, and to characterize them. To do so, I used the Mask-RCNN library. If you want to know more about it, [the magazine Vice wrote an article about it](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/m7q33x/scientists-are-encrypting-information-using-crystals).

After many rejections I have finally published a "paper" in Nature. Although it is not exactly a scientific paper, but an opinion piece about science. It is about how dissapointing it is to send out grant applications - with many hours and favours invested - only to receive a rejection followed by a comment like "no feedback will be given". I could continue speaking about this, but it is probably better if you read it yourselves: 

["Dear grant agencies: tell me where I went wrong."](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00444-x)

I actually enjoyed the process of writing a non-scientific piece, and hopefully I will do it again in the future.

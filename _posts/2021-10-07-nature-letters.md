I have published a second opinion piece in Nature. As before, not exactly about science, but about the our careers in science. Although this opinion piece is about Letters of Support or recommendation, my main criticism is towards the insane quantity of documents funding agencies want. I was now almost going to apply to a 5k grant (so almost nothing) and they required two letters of support!. Anyway, chece the piece by yourselves:

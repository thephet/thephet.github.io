Today I joined Glasgow Caledonian University (GCU) to start a lecturership in Robotics (Department of Mechanical Engineering). It is of course very exciting!.
GCU is what in the UK they call "new university", it is barely 30 years old. My new position is mostly going to be about teaching and working with students, and I very welcome this change.

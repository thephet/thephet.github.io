After a very long process, which I think took almost 4 years, the paper we internally called "BZ2" has finally been published in *Nature Communications*. This paper is a follow-up of my 2020 paper about using chemistry to perform computations. You can check that old paper [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15190-3).

Calling it a follow-up would be a disservice. We used a similar platform and chemistry (the BZ reaction), but the experiments done took the idea to the next level. My work here mostly consisted on the technical side of things, while the other authors did the interesting science. I wonder where this research will go next!

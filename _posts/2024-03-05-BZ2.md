I have published a third opinion piece in Nature. This one is about how ChatGPT shows how the current application system is broken. ChatGPT is not the problem, and people using it are not the problem. The problem is why we need to use it? Why grant proposals need to be so long with so many sections? Anyway, check the piece by yourselves:
